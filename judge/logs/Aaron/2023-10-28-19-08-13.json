The new chat history is as follows:\n<history> Leo said that :The case is as follows: \n<case>\n The plaintiff told a well-known brand mobile phone company in Guangzhou for infringing on its workers' rights and interests. Plaintiff viewpoint: On September 30, 2023, under defendant's recommendation, I started part-time work as a sales promoter in the mobile phone company where defendant works. Due to my trust in defendant, I did not sign any contract with the company at that time. We only had an oral agreement that I would be paid 20 yuan per day for promotions and receive a monthly salary. However, after working for two months, defendant and his company refused to pay the promised salary, citing that I was not their official contract worker. Despite my repeated attempts to claim the unpaid wages, they continued to reject me. These facts are supported by the company's ID card, promotional sales records, work sign-in sheets, and the testimony of witness Mike. Defendant viewpoint: What the plaintiff stated is not entirely true. On September 30, 2009, I did introduce the position of promoter of our company to the plaintiff, in order to provide the plaintiff with a free opportunity for social practice training. Because the plaintiff was only an intern and part-time employee in our company, he was not included in the company's regular employees, so there was no need to sign a formal labor contract. This is in accordance with the rules and regulations of my company, so I'm not cheating.\n<case>\n As the plaintiff, what should I do?Mike said that :Based on the provided chat history, the plaintiff can gather evidence such as the company's ID card, promotional sales records, work sign-in sheets, and the testimony of witness Mike to support their claim for unpaid wages. The plaintiff should also consider obtaining any additional evidence, such as communication records or emails, that may further strengthen their case.Alex said that :Based on the plaintiff's viewpoint and the evidence provided, it is clear that there was an oral agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant's company regarding the payment of wages. The plaintiff should proceed with filing a lawsuit against the company for breach of contract and claim the unpaid wages. Additionally, the plaintiff should gather any additional evidence, such as communication records or emails, to further strengthen their case.\n</history>\n            </information>;\nPlease continue the talk based on your known information,Make an effort to make the conversation more coherent and  try to respond differently from your existing knowledge, avoiding repeating what others have said.Please keep your reply as concise as possible,Within three sentences, the total word count should not exceed 30"

  "output": "Counter defendant's argument: The defendant's claim that the plaintiff was only an intern and part-time employee does not negate the fact that there was an oral agreement between the parties regarding the payment of wages. The plaintiff should emphasize that regardless of their employment status, they are entitled to be compensated for the work they performed based on the agreement made with the defendant's company."
