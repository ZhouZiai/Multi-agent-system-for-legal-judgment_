The new chat history is as follows:\n<history> Leo said that :The case is as follows: \n<case>\n The plaintiff told a well-known brand mobile phone company in Guangzhou for infringing on its workers' rights and interests. Plaintiff viewpoint: On September 30, 2023, under defendant's recommendation, I started part-time work as a sales promoter in the mobile phone company where defendant works. Due to my trust in defendant, I did not sign any contract with the company at that time. We only had an oral agreement that I would be paid 20 yuan per day for promotions and receive a monthly salary. However, after working for two months, defendant and his company refused to pay the promised salary, citing that I was not their official contract worker. Despite my repeated attempts to claim the unpaid wages, they continued to reject me. These facts are supported by the company's ID card, promotional sales records, work sign-in sheets, and the testimony of witness Mike. Defendant viewpoint: What the plaintiff stated is not entirely true. On September 30, 2009, I did introduce the position of promoter of our company to the plaintiff, in order to provide the plaintiff with a free opportunity for social practice training. Because the plaintiff was only an intern and part-time employee in our company, he was not included in the company's regular employees, so there was no need to sign a formal labor contract. This is in accordance with the rules and regulations of my company, so I'm not cheating.\n<case>\n As the plaintiff, what should I do?Mike said that :Based on the provided chat history, the plaintiff's claim is supported by evidence such as the company's ID card, promotional sales records, work sign-in sheets, and the testimony of witness Mike. The defendant's argument that the plaintiff was only an intern and part-time employee should be further investigated to determine if it aligns with the company's rules and regulations.Alex said that :Based on the evidence provided by the plaintiff, such as the company's ID card, promotional sales records, work sign-in sheets, and the testimony of witness Mike, it seems that the plaintiff had a valid agreement with the defendant's company and is entitled to the unpaid wages. However, further investigation is needed to determine if the defendant's argument about the plaintiff being an intern and part-time employee aligns with the company's rules and regulations.Aaron said that :Counter defendant's argument by pointing out that the plaintiff's status as an intern and part-time employee does not necessarily negate their entitlement to wages, especially if there was an oral agreement in place. Further investigation should be conducted to determine if the defendant's claim aligns with the company's rules and regulations.\n</history>\n            </information>;\nPlease continue the talk based on your known information,Make an effort to make the conversation more coherent and  try to respond differently from your existing knowledge, avoiding repeating what others have said.Please keep your reply as concise as possible,Within three sentences, the total word count should not exceed 30"
