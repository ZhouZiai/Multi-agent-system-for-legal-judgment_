Plaintiff viewpoint: On September 30, 2023, under defendant's recommendation, I started part-time work as a sales promoter in the mobile phone company where defendant works. Due to my trust in defendant, I did not sign any contract with the company at that time. We only had an oral agreement that I would be paid 20 yuan per day for promotions and receive a monthly salary. However, after working for two months, defendant and his company refused to pay the promised salary, citing that I was not their official contract worker. Despite my repeated attempts to claim the unpaid wages, they continued to reject me. These facts are supported by the company's ID card, promotional sales records, work sign-in sheets, and the testimony of witness Mike. Defendant viewpoint: What the plaintiff stated is not entirely true. On September 30, 2009, I did introduce the position of promoter of our company to the plaintiff, in order to provide the plaintiff with a free opportunity for social practice training. Because the plaintiff was only an intern and part-time employee in our company, he was not included in the company's regular employees, so there was no need to sign a formal labor contract. This is in accordance with the rules and regulations of my company, so I'm not cheating.\n<case>\n As the plaintiff, what should I do?Mike said that :Based on the chat history, the plaintiff claims to have an oral agreement with the defendant's company for a monthly salary and unpaid wages. The plaintiff has provided evidence such as ID card, promotional sales records, work sign-in sheets, and the testimony of witness Mike to support their case. It is important to further investigate the company's policies and regulations regarding part-time employees and determine if the plaintiff's claims are valid.Alex said that :Based on the plaintiff's viewpoint and the evidence provided, it is clear that there was an oral agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant's company regarding the payment of wages. The plaintiff should pursue legal action to claim the unpaid wages and seek compensation for the breach of contract.\n\nIt is crucial to examine the company's policies and regulations regarding part-time employees to determine if the plaintiff's claims are valid. Additionally, it may be beneficial to gather more witness testimonies or evidence to strengthen the case against the defendant's company.Aaron said that :Counter defendant's viewpoint by emphasizing that the plaintiff's claim is not about being a regular employee, but rather about the oral agreement for payment of wages. Highlight the evidence provided by the plaintiff, such as the ID card, promotional sales records, work sign-in sheets, and witness testimony, which support their case. Suggest further investigation into the company's policies and regulations regarding part-time employees to determine the validity of the plaintiff's claims.\n</history>\n            </information>;\nPlease continue the talk based on your known information,Make an effort to make the conversation more coherent and  try to respond differently from your existing knowledge, avoiding repeating what others have said.Please keep your reply as concise as possible,Within three sentences, the total word count should not exceed 30"
