Plaintiff viewpoint: On September 30, 2023, under defendant's recommendation, I started part-time work as a sales promoter in the mobile phone company where defendant works. Due to my trust in defendant, I did not sign any contract with the company at that time. We only had an oral agreement that I would be paid 20 yuan per day for promotions and receive a monthly salary. However, after working for two months, defendant and his company refused to pay the promised salary, citing that I was not their official contract worker. Despite my repeated attempts to claim the unpaid wages, they continued to reject me. These facts are supported by the company's ID card, promotional sales records, work sign-in sheets, and the testimony of witness Mike. Defendant viewpoint: What the plaintiff stated is not entirely true. On September 30, 2009, I did introduce the position of promoter of our company to the plaintiff, in order to provide the plaintiff with a free opportunity for social practice training. Because the plaintiff was only an intern and part-time employee in our company, he was not included in the company's regular employees, so there was no need to sign a formal labor contract. This is in accordance with the rules and regulations of my company, so I'm not cheating.\n<case>\n As the plaintiff, what should I do?Mike said that :Based on the chat history, the plaintiff claims to have an oral agreement with the defendant's company for a monthly salary and unpaid wages.
