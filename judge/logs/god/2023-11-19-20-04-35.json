They should focus on presenting evidence such as ID card, promotional sales records, work sign-in sheets, and witness testimony to prove the existence of the oral agreement and the defendant's failure to fulfill their obligations. Seeking legal advice to develop a strong legal strategy is recommended.;The chat history is as follows:\n<chat> Leo said that :浜嬫儏鏄繖涓牱瀛愮殑锛屽反鎷夊反鎷夊反鎷夊惂The case is as follows: \n<case>\n The plaintiff told a well-known brand mobile phone company in Guangzhou for infringing on its workers' rights and interests. Plaintiff viewpoint: On September 30, 2023, under defendant's recommendation, I started part-time work as a sales promoter in the mobile phone company where defendant works. Due to my trust in defendant, I did not sign any contract with the company at that time. We only had an oral agreement that I would be paid 20 yuan per day for promotions and receive a monthly salary. However, after working for two months, defendant and his company refused to pay the promised salary, citing that I was not their official contract worker. Despite my repeated attempts to claim the unpaid wages, they continued to reject me. These facts are supported by the company's ID card, promotional sales records, work sign-in sheets, and the testimony of witness Mike. Defendant viewpoint: What the plaintiff stated is not entirely true. On September 30, 2009, I did introduce the position of promoter of our company to the plaintiff, in order to provide the plaintiff with a free opportunity for social practice training. Because the plaintiff was only an intern and part-time employee in our company, he was not included in the company's regular employees, so there was no need to sign a formal labor contract. This is in accordance with the rules and regulations of my company, so I'm not cheating.\n<case>\n As the plaintiff, what should I do?Mike said that :Based on the chat history, the plaintiff claims to have an oral agreement with the defendant's company for a monthly salary and unpaid wages.

Suggest further investigation into the company's policies and regulations regarding part-time employees to determine the validity of the plaintiff's claims.Alice said that :The plaintiff's stance is that they had an oral agreement with the defendant's company for a monthly salary and unpaid wages.
