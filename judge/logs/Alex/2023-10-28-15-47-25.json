Plaintiff viewpoint: On September 30, 2023, under defendant's recommendation, I started part-time work as a sales promoter in the mobile phone company where defendant works. Due to my trust in defendant, I did not sign any contract with the company at that time. We only had an oral agreement that I would be paid 20 yuan per day for promotions and receive a monthly salary. However, after working for two months, defendant and his company refused to pay the promised salary, citing that I was not their official contract worker. Despite my repeated attempts to claim the unpaid wages, they continued to reject me. These facts are supported by the company's ID card, promotional sales records, work sign-in sheets, and the testimony of witness Mike. Defendant viewpoint: What the plaintiff stated is not entirely true. On September 30, 2009, I did introduce the position of promoter of our company to the plaintiff, in order to provide the plaintiff with a free opportunity for social practice training.

  "output": "Based on the plaintiff's oral agreement and the supporting evidence, we can argue that the plaintiff was indeed an employee of the defendant's company and is entitled to the promised salary. We can also challenge the defendant's claim that the plaintiff was only an intern and part-time employee by highlighting the duration of their employment and the nature of their work. Additionally, we should emphasize the importance of honoring oral agreements and the legal obligations of employers to pay their employees."
