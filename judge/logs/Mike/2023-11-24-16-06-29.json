Plaintiff viewpoint: On September 30, 2023, under defendant's recommendation, I started part-time work as a sales promoter in the mobile phone company where defendant works. Due to my trust in defendant, I did not sign any contract with the company at that time. We only had an oral agreement that I would be paid 20 yuan per day for promotions and receive a monthly salary. However, after working for two months, defendant and his company refused to pay the promised salary, citing that I was not their official contract worker. Despite my repeated attempts to claim the unpaid wages, they continued to reject me. These facts are supported by the company's ID card, promotional sales records, work sign-in sheets, and the testimony of witness Mike. Defendant viewpoint: What the plaintiff stated is not entirely true. On September 30, 2009, I did introduce the position of promoter of our company to the plaintiff, in order to provide the plaintiff with a free opportunity for social practice training. Because the plaintiff was only an intern and part-time employee in our company, he was not included in the company's regular employees, so there was no need to sign a formal labor contract. This is in accordance with the rules and regulations of my company, so I'm not cheating.\n<case>\n As the plaintiff, what should I do?\n</history>\n            </information>;\nPlease continue the talk based on your known information,Make an effort to make the conversation more coherent and  try to respond differently from your existing knowledge, avoiding repeating what others have said.Please keep your reply as concise as possible,Within three sentences, the total word count should not exceed 30"

  "output": "Based on the evidence provided, it is clear that the plaintiff worked for the defendant's company as a sales promoter without signing a formal contract. The plaintiff's claim for unpaid wages is supported by the company's ID card, promotional sales records, work sign-in sheets, and the testimony of witness Mike. The defendant's argument that the plaintiff was only an intern and not included in the regular employees does not negate the plaintiff's right to be paid for the work performed."
